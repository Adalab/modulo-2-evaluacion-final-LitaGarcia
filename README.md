# :cherry_blossom:	 Best Anime Searcher Ever :cherry_blossom:	

In this repo you will see a basic search of Animes made with Js.

## How to start with this applicationðŸš€

If you are a developer, and want to include some changes, you just need two things.
You need to install de dependencies using 
*npm install*
You can run the project using
*npm start*

> Otherwise... you dont need to clone this repo in your local, you just need to access in the link that you can find it under the [owner's repository]( http://beta.adalab.es/modulo-2-evaluacion-final-LitaGarcia/)

Enjoy! :wink:

## Functionalities :dizzy:

The next functionalities where required by our customers:

- The users search the anime and can add into a favorites list includes in the left of the page. 
- There are Animes withouts images, in this case, the api gave us a default image, but we decided to gave another image.
- We can add our searched animes into a favorites list clicking.
- When the users add one Anime into fav list and refresh the page, their dates will be saved (thanks to a functionality to add to LocalStorage).
- When an anime is included into favorite list, their apparence will change too.

## Technical Features :hammer:

This entire project has been created with Java, highlighting the use of functions to try to create a clean and tidy code.
We have used 'partials' to organize the code according to functionalities.

We have created different tickets and branches on GitHub to organize the work, in this way when a ticket was completed, it was uploaded to the main branch while the others were tested, as well as a Kanban to try to follow an agile philosophy.

## Bonus and improvements	ðŸŽ¯

We did small interactions and improvements in the code that help the use of the application such as:

- Limit the elements from the api into 5 (helps visual reading of the page)
- Add a remark when the user searchs a non-existent Anime
- Refactor all the functions into new functions
- Give a "hand-click" into the cards, so the users know that is a clickable element
- Rename all the variables and functions to make a better reading
- Make possible press enter into the search input
- When the users click again into an anime list that is already into fav list, they can remove it from favs
- We have used advanced DOM to create some parts of the HTML
- Refactorize the code doing array methods as map or slice.

## What I would have liked to do:cry:

- Refactorize all the code into new (and smalls) functions to give a better reading
- Make another map when we get the elements from the api to change the name's properties of the objects
- Do a better CSS
- I wish I had rested more to have a more global vision and given a simpler logic
